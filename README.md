# rotary-encoder-signal-analysis-lib
Library to sample & analyse digital pulse signals, as generated by rotary encoders, and calculate velocity & position for rotary encoders



 ## Current State

 - Analyse single pole digital waveforms & calculate time HIGH, time LOW, period, frequency & duty cycle.

## Future Development
- Add calcuations for deriving velocity for single pole rotary encoders (e.g: as found in flow meters)
- Add calculations for deriving position for double pole rotary encoders (needed to sense direction of movement)
- Add calculations for deriving velocity for double pole rotary encoders
- Add calcuations for multi pole rotary encoders
