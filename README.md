# rotary-encoder-angle
 Simple program to return the angle of a rotary encoder along with a timestamp



 ## Current State

 - Analyse single pole digital waveforms & calculate time HIGH, time LOW, period, frequency & duty cycle.

## Future Development
- Add calcuations for deriving velocity for single pole rotary encoders (e.g: as found in flow meters)
- Add calculations for deriving position for double pole rotary encoders (needed to sense direction of movement)
- Add calculations for deriving velocity for double pole rotary encoders
- Add calcuations for multi pole rotary encoders
